Hello, I created a web page about me, on what the things I like, and also a fan page about my favorite soccer club. The Home page links to my page, The first page John. The second page is a fan page i on my favorite soccer team. The third page is on the programming languages I'm learning. The fourth page is about coffee, which is also linked from my list of things I like.
